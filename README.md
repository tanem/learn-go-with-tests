## Background

This repo contains the code I created as I worked through @quii's [Learn Go with Tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests) book. As a Golang Newbie I highly recommend the book as it struck a nice balance between learning a new language and using it in anger.

## My Approach

For **Go Fundamentals**, I worked through each section writing my own version of the code samples and taking the time to understand anything I wasn't sure of. I then cross-checked my version of the code against the most recent version contained in the original repo.

For **Build an Application**, I read each section top-to-bottom taking the time to completely understand each of the code samples. I then based my own version of that section's code on the most recent version contained in the original repo.

In both cases, I allowed myself to dive down into rabbitholes as I referred to external documentation, presentations, books and the like. This meant it took me quite a while to work through the book, but this was fine since I was more concerned with learning than shipping this repo quickly.

## Editor Setup

I used the [Go Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Some Useful Learning Material

- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/)
- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)
- [Golang Weekly](https://golangweekly.com/)
- [Golang tutorial series](https://golangbot.com/learn-golang-series/)
- [Gophers on Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)
- [The Little Go Book](https://openmymind.net/The-Little-Go-Book/)

Plus a whole bunch of code reading from repos on GitHub.
